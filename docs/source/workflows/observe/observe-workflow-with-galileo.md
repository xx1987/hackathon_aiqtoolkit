# Observing a Workflow with Galileo

This guide shows how to stream OpenTelemetry (OTel) traces from your NeMo Agent toolkit workflows to **Galileo** so that you can analyse performance, token usage, and latency directly in the Galileo console.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Create a project and log-stream in Galileo and generate an API key.
- Configure your workflow (YAML) or Python script to export traces to Galileo.
- Run the workflow and view traces in the Galileo UI.

---

### Step 1. Create a project and API key in Galileo

1. Sign in to the [Galileo console](https://app.galileo.ai/).
2. Create a new **Logging** project (or reuse an existing one).
3. Inside the project create (or locate) the **Log Stream** you will write to.
4. From **Settings → API Keys** generate a new API key and copy it.

You will need the following values in the next steps:

- `Galileo-API-Key`
- `project` (project name)
- `logstream` (log-stream name)

### Step 2: Modify Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:
```bash
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        _type: console
        level: WARN
    tracing:
      galileo:
        _type: galileo
        # Cloud endpoint – change if you are using an on-prem cluster.
        endpoint: https://app.galileo.ai/api/galileo/otel/traces
        project: simple_calculator
        logstream: default
        api_key: "<YOUR-GALILEO-API-KEY>"
```

### Step 3. Run the workflow

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple_calculator
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml --input "2 + 2"
```

As the workflow runs, spans are exported to Galileo and (optionally) printed to your console.
Open the [Galileo console](https://app.galileo.ai/), select your project, and navigate to **Traces**. New traces should appear within a few seconds.

### Debugging
Galileo relies on the OpenInference libraries. Which are included in the following dependency:

```bash
uv pip install arize-phoenix
```

For additional help, see the [Galileo OpenTelemetry integration docs](https://v2docs.galileo.ai/integrations/otel).

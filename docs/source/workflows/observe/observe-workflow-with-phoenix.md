# Observing a Workflow with Phoenix

This guide provides a step-by-step process to enable observability in a NeMo Agent toolkit workflow using Phoenix for tracing and logging. By the end of this guide, you will have:
- Configured telemetry in your workflow.
- Run the Phoenix server.
- Able to view traces in the Phoenix UI.


### Step 1: Modify Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:
```bash
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        _type: console
        level: WARN
    tracing:
      phoenix:
        _type: phoenix
        endpoint: http://localhost:6006/v1/traces
        project: simple_calculator
```
This setup enables:
- Console logging with WARN level messages.
- Tracing through Phoenix at `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces`.

### Step 2: Start the Phoenix Server
Run the following command to start Phoenix server locally:
```bash
phoenix serve
```
Phoenix should now be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:6006`.

### Step 3: Run Your Workflow
From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, install dependencies and execute your workflow.

**Example:**
```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_web_query
```
As the workflow runs, telemetry data will start showing up in Phoenix and the console.

### Step 4: View Traces Data in Phoenix
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:6006`.
- Locate your workflow traces under the **Traces** section in projects.
- Inspect function execution details, latency, total tokens, request timelines and other info under Info and Attributes tab of an individual trace.

### Debugging
If you encounter issues while downloading the Phoenix package, try uninstalling and installing:
```bash
uv pip uninstall arize-phoenix

uv pip install arize-phoenix
```

After reinstalling, restart the Phoenix server:
```bash
phoenix serve
```

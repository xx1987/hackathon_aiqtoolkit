# Run NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

A workflow is defined by a YAML configuration file that specifies the tools and models to use. NeMo Agent toolkit provides the following ways to run a workflow:
- Using the `aiq run` command.
   - This is the simplest and most common way to run a workflow.
- Using the `aiq serve` command.
   - This starts a web server that listens for incoming requests and runs the specified workflow.
- Using the `aiq eval` command.
   - In addition to running the workflow, it also evaluates the accuracy of the workflow.
- Using the Python API
   - This is the most flexible way to run a workflow.

## Using the `aiq run` Command
The `aiq run` command is the simplest way to run a workflow. `aiq run` receives a configuration file as specified by the `--config_file` flag, along with input that can be specified either directly with the `--input` flag or by providing a file path with the `--input_file` flag.

A typical invocation of the `aiq run` command follows this pattern:
```
aiq run --config_file <path/to/config.yml> [--input "question?" | --input_file <path/to/input.txt>]
```

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow with a single input question "What is LangSmith?":
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"
```

The following command runs the same workflow with the input question provided in a file:
```bash
echo "What is LangSmith?" > .tmp/input.txt
aiq run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input_file .tmp/input.txt
```

## Using the `aiq eval` Command
The `aiq eval` command is similar to the `aiq run` command. However, in addition to running the workflow, it also evaluates the accuracy of the workflow, refer to [Evaluating NeMo Agent toolkit Workflows](../workflows/evaluate.md) for more information.

## Using the `aiq serve` Command
The `aiq serve` command starts a web server that listens for incoming requests and runs the specified workflow. The server can be accessed with a web browser or by sending a POST request to the server's endpoint. Similar to the `aiq run` command, the `aiq serve` command requires a configuration file specified by the `--config_file` flag.

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow on a web server listening to the default port `8000` and default endpoint of `/generate`:
```bash
aiq serve --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml
```

In a separate terminal, run the following command to send a POST request to the server:
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "input_message": "What is LangSmith?"
}'
```

Refer to `aiq serve --help` for more information on how to customize the server.

## Using the Python API

The toolkit offers a programmatic way to execute workflows through its Python API, allowing you to integrate workflow execution directly into your Python code. Here's how to use it:

```python
from aiq.runtime.loader import load_workflow

async with load_workflow(config_file) as workflow:
   async with workflow.run(input_str) as runner:
      result = await runner.result(to_type=str)
```

In this example:
- `config_file`: A string path pointing to your workflow YAML file
- `input_str`: A string containing the input for your workflow
- The `workflow.run(input_str)` method returns an instance of {py:class}`~aiq.runtime.runner.AIQRunner`

For detailed information about the `AIQRunner` class and its capabilities, please refer to the Python API documentation for the {py:class}`~aiq.runtime.runner.AIQRunner` class.

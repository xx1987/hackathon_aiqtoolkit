# NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- **Workflow Not Found**: Ensure that your workflow is correctly registered and that the `_type` in your configuration file matches the workflow's `_type`.

- **Dependency Issues**: Verify that all required dependencies are listed in your `pyproject.toml` file and installed. If in doubt run `uv sync --all-groups --all-extras` from the root of the repository.

- **Environment Variables**: Double-check that your `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is correctly set.

- **[429] Too Many Requests**: This error might arise during executing workflows that involve LLM calls because of rate limiting on the LLM models. It is recommended to pause briefly and then attempt the operation again a few times. For warm fix set the `parse_agent_response_max_retries: 1` in `config.yaml` for the `react_agent`. Usually happens that the `react_agent` exhausts the available LLM rate with entire error stack trace.

# Agent Intelligence Toolkit Examples

Each NVIDIA Agent Intelligence (AIQ) toolkit example demonstrates a particular feature or use case of the NeMo Agent toolkit library. Most of these contain a custom [workflow](../docs/source/tutorials/index.md) along with a set of custom tools ([functions](../docs/source/workflows/functions/index.md) in NeMo Agent toolkit). These examples can be used as a starting off point for creating your own custom workflows and tools. Each example contains a `README.md` file that explains the use case along with instructions on how to run the example.

## Installation and Setup

To run the examples, install the NeMo Agent toolkit from source, if you haven't already done so, by following the instructions in [Install From Source](../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source).
